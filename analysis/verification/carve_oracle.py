"""The public carve oracle -- a third source for recovered content, runnable from a clone.

Why this exists. The v1.13.0 release classified 111 refused carves as fabrications without a ground-truth
control, and was wrong: 86 of them are byte-identical to the file that is still live. The control was on the
same public volume the whole time. This oracle IS that control, so the classification cannot be issued
without it again.

Three independent sources, none of them this tool's opinion of itself:
  1. the LIVE TWIN -- the file still on the volume with the same name and size as the deleted remnant;
  2. WINDOWS' OWN JOURNAL -- `fsutil usn readjournal`, exported on the live system before imaging and
     shipped with the sample (provenance/usn_readjournal_export.txt). It holds history the image's
     journal ring has since overwritten;
  3. the carve itself.

A twin is used only when Windows' journal shows its data was written in ONE close-bounded episode and
never changed afterwards: then any prior version captured after that write must equal the live file.

For each such file the oracle requires one of:
  * the carve EQUALS the twin;
  * the carve differs ONLY inside the runs the tool DISCLOSED as zero-filled (`unwritten_runs` in the
    manifest), and is zero there;
  * there is no carve, and the manifest says why (`refused_all_unwritten`).
Anything else fails: a difference outside disclosed runs is invented content; a refusal without a reason
is silent loss.
